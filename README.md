A neural network is a network or circuit of [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron), or in a modern sense, an [artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), composed of [artificial neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron) or nodes.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network#cite_note-1) Thus a neural network is either a [biological neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neural_network), made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, for solving [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI) problems. The connections of the biological neuron are modeled as weights. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred to as a linear combination. Finally, an activation function controls the [amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude) of the output. For example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be âˆ’1 and 1.
